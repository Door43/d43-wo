Ten years after Abram and Sarai arrived in Canaan, they still did not have a child. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, "Since God has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my servant, Hagar. Marry her also so she can have a child for me."


Wol:Fukki aat ba Abram ak Sarai agse cha Canaan, ngom be tay amungu dom. legi jabaru Abram, Sarai, neko, "Kom Yalla naango guma maye dom te legi maaget ma pour jur, suma jaam ageni, Hagar. Takka ko ndah ga am dom ak mom."

So Abram married Hagar. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him Ishmael. But Sarai became jealous of Hagar. When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again spoke to Abram.


Abram daldi seye ak Hagar. Hagar jur dom bu gor, Abram tuday ko Ishmael. Waye Sarai dor di fiire Hagar. Be Ishmael amey fukki at ak neet, Yalla wahat ak Abram.\\

God said, "I am God Almighty. I will make a covenant with you." Then Abram bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, "You will be the father of many nations. I will give you and your descendants the land of Canaan as their possession and I will be their God forever. You must circumcise every male in your family."


Yalla ne, " man maye Yalla bu Magagi. Dina def dige ak yow." Abram daldi segga surgal. God tamit ne Abram, "Diga don baye race gu barri. Di nala joh ak sa jaboot gi sufu Canaan mu don lingu mom te sah dina don sen Yalla be abanan. Fog gor gu nek chi sa jaboot jonga."\\

"Your wife, Sarai, will have a sonâ€”he will be the son of promise. Name him Isaac. I will make my covenant with him, and he will become a great nation. I will make Ishmael a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac." Then God changed Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many." God also changed Sarai's name to Sarah, which means "princess."


"Sa jabarr, Sarai, dina am dom bu gor-dina don dom mu yakarbi. Tuddeeko Isaac. Dina tef dige ak mom, te dina don race gu magga.\\ 
Dina def Ishmael mu don race gu magga, tamit, waye suma dige dina don ak Isaac." Yalla nak daldi wecci turi Abram mu don Abraham, linu teeki moy "baye ngu barri." Yalla tamit wecci Sarai mu don Sarah, limu teeki moy "lingeer."\\

That day Abraham circumcised all the males in his household. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.

When Isaac was a young man, God tested Abraham's faith by saying, "Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me." Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to sacrifice his son.

As Abraham and Isaac walked to the place of sacrifice, Isaac asked, "Father, we have wood for the sacrifice, but where is the lamb?" Abraham replied, "God will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son."

When they reached the place of sacrifice, Abraham tied up his son Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was about to kill his son when God said, "Stop! Do not hurt the boy! Now I know that you fear me because you did not keep your only son from me."

Nearby Abraham saw a ram that was stuck in a bush. God had provided the ram to be the sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.

Then God said to Abraham, "Because you were willing to give me everything, even your only son, I promise to bless you. Your descendants will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you have obeyed me, all the families of the world will be blessed through your family."
