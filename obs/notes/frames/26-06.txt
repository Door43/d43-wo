**Jesus** continued saying, “And during the time of the **prophet Elisha**, there were many people in **Israel** with skin diseases. But Elisha did not **heal** any of them. He only healed the skin disease of **Naaman**, **a commander** of Israel’s enemies.” The people who were listening to Jesus were **Jews**. So when they heard him say this, **they were furious at him**.
