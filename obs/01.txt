This is how the beginning of everything happened. God created the universe and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But God's Spirit was there over the water.


Nee nak la leepp dooree. Cha jalben Yalla sakka na aduna ak leep chi jurome ben fann. Bi yalla sahke aduna dafa lendem te anoullon darra xoota la won.\\ 
Waay hel muy sella bu Yalla monga fofa worr ndox ma

Then God said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which he called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.


Te Yalla ne, " na leer bi feex! nag leer daldi feex. Yalla gis nu leer be rafete nak mou tudde ko borset njekkee lu fan nu jur.

On the second day of creation, God spoke and created the sky above the earth. He made the sky by separating the water above from the water below.


Naareel lu fan nu jur, Yalla dal di waha rek asaman daldi am. Defarr na Asaman ci darra. Yàlla defar benn diggante ci kaw suuf. Mu tudde ko asamaan.

On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and he called the water "seas." God saw that what he had created was good.


Ci ñettéélu fann bi, Yàlla wax ne, ndox yi muuroon suuf si war nañu nekk ay géej ak ay dex. Kon Yàlla hajahle suuf si ak ndox bi.Yalla hol ne limou sakk rafet na.\\

Then God said, "Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants." And that is what happened. God saw that what he had created was good.


Yàlla saxaloon na fi tamit ay ñax, ay àll ak ay garab. Loolu yépp nekkoon na ci troisième jour bi muy sàkk àddina

On the fourth day of creation, God spoke and made the sun, the moon, and the stars. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years. God saw that what he had created was good.


Ci ñeentéélu fann bi, Yàlla def jant bi mu leeral bëccëg bi. Mu def tamit\\ 
weer bi ak biddiiw yi ñu leeral guddi gi.

On the fifth day, God spoke and made everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and he blessed them.


Ci juróoméélu fann bi, Yàlla sàkk ay jën yu réy ak yu tuuti yuy dundu ci géej gi. Mu sàkk ay picc yu mel ni ay pitax, kanaara, céeli, ak ay ramatu yuy naaw ci jawji di dundu ci àll bi ak ci tool yi.

On the sixth day of creation, God said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good.


Ci juróom-bennéélu fann bi, Yàlla sàkk ay rabu àll yuy dox ci kaw suuf yu mel ni ñay, gaynde ak segg. Mu sàkk tamit ay rab yu soxorul yu mel ni njombor, fas, nag ak xar. Mu sàkk tamit ay gunoor yu tuuti yu mel ni melantaan ak yëmbb.

Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."


Yalla daldi wah ne, " Na ngu sak nit chi su nju meloukan. Ndah ngu am doole eliff rabou adunabi yep."

So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.


Noonu Yalla jel suf bou tilim deffar ci nit,te mou nooki dunda chi moom. Nit ki moy don Adama. Yalla sahal tool chi fou Adama nara dekah, mou baiko tool bi nak mu diko topato


{{:https:api.unfoldingword.org:obs:jpg:1:en:360px:obs-en-01-11.jpg?nolink&}}


In the middle of the garden, God planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.


Ci biir tool bi, Yàlla saxaloon na fa ay garab yu bari, yu fees dell ak ay ñam yu neex. Yàlla wax Aadama, ne ko, ‘Mën nga lekk ci ñammu garab yi yépp ba mu des benn’. Garab boobu moo doon garabu ‘xam lu baax ak lu bon. ’

Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.


Aadama dafa wéetoon, ndaxte ci àddina bi yépp moom rekk moo fi nekkoon nit. Kon Yàlla di sàkk beneen nit bu wara wéetali Aadama ak di ko dimbali.

So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.


Yalla nak daldi def chi Adam neelow bou diex. Yalla ganee jaah chi farou Adama defarr chi jegeen na mou daldi ko inndel Adama.


{{:https:api.unfoldingword.org:obs:jpg:1:en:360px:obs-en-01-14.jpg?nolink&}}


When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.


Bi ko Adama ges seh, mou ne, "ndoka! li de kom mann! dina ko toudeh 'Jegeen', dik chi maan la jogaye. "Lee motah gor jogaye kerr bayaam ak yayaam ngow neka benn ak jarbarram.


{{:https:api.unfoldingword.org:obs:jpg:1:en:360px:obs-en-01-15.jpg?nolink&}}


God made man and woman in his own image. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" And God saw that everything he had made was very good, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


Yalla sahk na nit chi melukanam. Mou barkelen te nelen, "jurlen ey doom you bary te fesal aduna bi!" Yalla nak gis ne leep linou sak agi sekk, mou begeh chi lool. Li leep hew chi juróom-ben fan nu jur.

When the seventh day came, God had finished his work. So God rested from all he had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.


Be juróom-narel lu fan wa joteh, Yalla daldi sutal ligeey yam. Yalla nak nopalekou chi ligeey geem don def leep. Mou barke fan bi te selal ko, dahde daf ko def besu nopal. Ni la Yalla sakke aduna ak li mou aam yeep.
