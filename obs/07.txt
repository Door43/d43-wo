As the boys grew up, Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt. Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau.

Nu xale ye di maagey, Jacob don ku buga tok kerr, waye Esau dononna ku buga roob. Rebekak buggona Jacob lool, waye Isaac nak Esau la buggon.\\

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, "Please give me some of the food you have made." Jacob responded, "First, give me your rights as the oldest son." So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.

Bena bes, be Esau wenneeko roob, mu xiifon lool, Esau daldi ne Jacob, "Lel maima chi lekk gi nga defarr."Jacob tontu," Ngekama, joxma ca dona tawu kerr," Legi Esau daldi ko jox Jacob dona tawu kerr gi.

Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau's clothes and put goatskins on his neck and hands.

Isaac bugonna jok barkeem Esau. Waye ballay mu koy def, Rebekah ak Jocob pexel ko chi def Jacob am melukanu Esau. Isaac maget tona be gisatul. Jocob nak daldi sol yere Esau te def kawari beay chi baat tam ak chi lohomeey.

Jacob came to Isaac and said, "I am Esau. I have come so that you can bless me." When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

Jacob daldi njow chi Isaac te neko, "Man may Isau. Nyow na nak dax nga barkel ma." Be Isaac laley kawaru baey bi te hentu yereey, mu yakarni nak Esau la te mu dal di ko barke.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

Esau sib bo Jacob lool nding Jacob ba sacha.....ni taawu kerr ak barkem. Nu daldi pexel Jacob pur rey ko bi sen baye faatoy.

But Rebekah heard of Esau's plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.

Waye Rebekah deega pexe Esau bi. Legi mom ak Isaac ebal Jacob fu sori ndax mu dekka chi mbookam ye.

Jacob lived with Rebekah's relatives for many years. During that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

Jacob dekka ak mbooki Rebekah ye ay aat  yu bari. Chi wahtu yoyu sey na be am fukki dom yu gor ak njarr ak benna dom bu jegeen. Yalla defko mu don borom alaal.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.

Naar fukki at ak naar bi mu bayeko kerram cha Canaan, Jacob delu fa ak jaboota ye, jarmaam ye, ak geete rab bam ye yep.

Jacob was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, "Your servant, Jacob, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon."

Jacob ragalon lool ndaxtee yakarr na be tay ni Esau bugga na ko rey. Mu daldi wone mayewu geete rab cha Esau. Jamaam ba yobuwon geeta ga ne Esau, "Sa jamaam, Jacob, mola weebal rab weey. Di na dikka leggi.

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham now passed on from Isaac to Jacob.

Waye Esau jot na balal Jacob, ngu beggon lool bingu gisante waat. Jacob amona jama ak hel bu dall cha fam decon Canaan. Leggi Isaac faatu, nak Jacob ak Esau suul ko. Dige gu Yalla dige yon Abraham te jar chi Isaac legi mugi chi Jacob.
