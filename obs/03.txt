After a long time, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It became so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.


Chi ey jamano you bari, nit ngi deka chi aduna bi jenna bari. Ngu don ngu soxor lool di def jeffi saey saey. Jef you boon di gena barry beh Yalla narra yaaxa aduna gi mou defarr ak yaaxu doh bou bari.

But Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send. He told Noah to build a huge boat.


Waay Yalla won na Noah yermande lol. dik nit kou mandula, de deka chi nit ngu bon ye. Yalla woh Noah yaaxu doh gi mou warra def chi aduna. Mu daldi wah Noah mu tabax saxaar ngu rey.

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.


Yalla neh Noah nu def guddayi saxaar gi 140 meetar, yatouway bi 23 meetar, te njolaay gi don 13.5. Te Noah dina tabax saxaarci ak bantta te dina am ci biram nyetti dekh, ey neeg you bari, mdar ci kaw, ak palanteer. Saxaarci dina saama Noah, ak jabota, ak bepp rab chi yaaxu doh gi naara am.

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the flood that was coming and told them to turn to God, but they did not believe him.


Noah dajal Yalla. Moom ak nyeeti domam eey tabax saxaar gi kom niko Yalla wahey. Jeel na ay at you bari balaay tabaxhu saxaarci sutal, ndig lu rey la won. Noah denku na nit nyi hibarru yaaxu doh mi wara dikka mune len ngu deelu chi Yalla, waay gomungu ko.

God also commanded Noah and his family to gather enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.


Yalla tami digal Noah ak jabota nyu buub lekah bu doy pur sen boop ak rab yeh. Bah lepp sutal le, Yalla wah Noah ne waahtu bi jotna pur mom, jabaram, neeti doma ye, ak senni jabarr nyu duga chi saxaarci nyo juroom neet yep.

God sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal that could be used for sacrifices. When they were all in the boat, God himself closed the door.


Yalla yonni Noah rab bu gor ak bu jegeen chi melucan bu nek ak picca nah nyu andakk mom chi saxaarci ndah nyu mucha yahu doh mi. Yalla dak yonni juroom njaaru rab you gor ak you jegeen chi melucan bu nek pour sarahey.Bi ngu neke chi saxaarci,Yalla ci boopam daldi tej bunta bi.

Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.


Nu dor di taw, di taw, di taw. Mu Taw njenetfuki fan ak njenetfuki gudi chi taw bu amul tahaw! Ndor mi daldi soteku jogayko cha assaman fesal sufi sep. Leep chi adunabi daldi fes ak ndor, be chi tunda bi genna mag.

Everything that lived on the dry land died, except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept everything inside the boat safe from drowning.


Leep li nekon chi suf ci daldi dey, sof nit ngi ak rab nyi nekon chi berr saxaar ci. Saxaar ci tombah chi bir ndor mi te saama leep li nekon chi biram banya lab.

After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.


Bem tawe be sotal, saxaarci tombah chi bir ndor mi chi joroome weer, te chi ber lolu ndor mi dor di waaneeku. Bes nyow saxaarci daldi terr chi kaw tund, waay betey aduna bangi fes son del ak ndor. Neeti weer sotal, kaw chetti tund bi dor di feen.

After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.


Nenentfuki fan sotal, Noah daldi wone picca…. pour set ndah ndorbi wow na. Picca bi daldi dem deluci ndah muna gis suf su wow, waay manula gis dara.

Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!


Noah daldi yoni wat benen picca. Waay tamit munula gis suf su wow, mu daldi delu wat cha Noah. Bes bu ay mu yoni picca wow, mu deluci wat ak banty olive chi geemen! Ndor mi mug don wangeku, te garab ey di sahat!

Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was drying up!


Noah harat beneen bes bu ay mu yoni wat picca netteelu yon. Wahtu bi na, picca bi daldi gis barab bu feexlu mu tog te delotul. Ndor mi leepa wow!

Two months later God said to Noah, "You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth." So Noah and his family came out of the boat.


Naari weer chi kanam Yalla ne Noah, "Yow ak sa jaboot ak rab ey yeep ngena saxaar ci.\\ 
Jur len ey dom te fesal suf ci." Nohna nak Noah ak jabootami daldi gena saxaar ci.\\

After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal that could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.


Bi Noah wacce saxaarci, mu tabax xamb de gene saraaxhu rab binge ko digal. Yalla daldi  chi saraax bi de barke Noah ak jabootam.

God said, "I promise I will never again curse the ground because of the evil things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though people are sinful from the time they are children."


Yalla ne, "Maggi dig ne duma mussa toroxa sufsi ngir jeef you bon you nit def, mballa def yaaxa ndor chi adunaci, mem sax nit bakarr\\ 
chi wahtu ndawam.\\

God then made the first rainbow as a sign of his promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what he promised and so would his people.
