Many years later, when Jacob was an old man, he sent his favorite son, Joseph, to check on his brothers who were taking care of the herds.

Chi at you bari, bi Jacob dike mag, mu daldi yoni domam ngi mu gena buga, Joseph, ndah mu seeti majam ey sama yeet.

Joseph's brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had dreamed that he would be their ruler. When Joseph came to his brothers, they kidnapped him and sold him to some slave traders.

Magam ey nak bange nagko lool dik sen baye mom la gena buga ka magam ey digg te tamit Joseph genntona ni dina len eliff. Bi Joseph aksey chi magam ey, ngu daldi ko jappa de jaay ko jendakati jaam ey.

Before Joseph's brothers returned home, they tore Joseph's robe and dipped it in goat's blood. Then they showed the robe to their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph. Jacob was very sad.

Balaay magey Joseph wee delusi,jelon na ngu mbubi Josep hottiko de daldi ko hogg chi deretu bay. Ngu daldi yon mbumbi sen baye dak mu fogni rabu ala rey Joseph. Jacob meron na lool.

The slave traders took Joseph to Egypt. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the Nile River. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy government official. Joseph served his master well, and God blessed Joseph.

Jendakatu jaam ey yobu Joseph cha Egypt. Egypt reyon na, te don tekka bu am dole neka cha guyju Nile. Jendakatu jaam ey jaay Joseph don jaam chi borom alal gu mag neko ngit chi ngurgi. Joseph legayal ngitam bu baah,te Yalla taam barkel ko.

His master's wife tried to sleep with Joseph, but Joseph refused to sin against God in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph remained faithful to God, and God blessed him.

Jabarri ngitam feeh pur tedda ak Joseph, waye Joseph bangena bakar chi kanamu Yalla chi anam bi. Mu daldi merr te sosal Joseph ndah ngu jabako te dencha ko kasso.Chi kasso bi sah, Joseph manduyona chi Yalla, te Yalla barkel nako.

After two years, Joseph was still in prison, even though he was innocent. One night, the Pharaoh, which is what the Egyptians called their kings, had two dreams that disturbed him greatly. None of his advisors could tell him the meaning of the dreams.

Njarri at chi ganaaw, Joseph angi woon chi kasso bi be teey, ne sah mo nekon chi degga. Ben gudi, Pharaona, ne wa Egypt tudde seni bureey, amona njarri genta yukko xatal lon lool. Ben chi ngukooy helal munu nguko feril teki genta ey.

God had given Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, "God is going to send seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of famine."

Yalla mayona Joseph hamhamu firi genta, legi Pharaona daldi ebal ngu yonnil ko Joseph gayneko cha kassoga. Joseph firel ko genta ey te ne ko, "Yalla dina indi juroom -narri atti juru ngeef gu bari, amale et atti nakka jur ak torox"

Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph that he appointed him to be the second most powerful man in all of Egypt!

Pharaona beg lool chi Joseph mu daldi ko joh palace mu don njarrelu nit bu opa doleh chi sufu Egypt gi yep!{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-09.jpg?direct&}}

Joseph told the people to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of famine came so they would have enough to eat.

Joseph wah nit nge yep ngu dencha dundu gu bari chi derr juroom narri attu jur gu bari gi. Legi Joseph dor di jaay dun bi juroom narri attu nakka dunda ak torox dikke ndah ngu muna am dundu gu doy.

The famine was severe not only in Egypt, but also in Canaan where Jacob and his family lived.

Nakka dunda gi meeti won na lool du chi won Egypt rek, waye itam chi Canaan fi Jacob ak jabootam deka.

So Jacob sent his older sons to Egypt to buy food. The brothers did not recognize Joseph when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.

Jacob daldi ebal doomam you magg ey cha Egypt ndah ngu jendi dun. Magam ey manu ngu hame Joseph bi ngu tooge chi kanamam di jenda dun. Waye Joseph xaamee na len.

After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph said to them, "I am your brother, Joseph! Do not be afraid. You tried to do evil when you sold me as a slave, but God used the evil for good! Come and live in Egypt so I can provide for you and your families."

Bi mu setlo magey pur hamni wecceku nang, Joseph daldi leen wah ni, "Manla sen rakka, Joseph! bulen tiit. Jeem gena def lou bon be ngen ma jaayey ma don Jaam, waye Yalla jel lu bon li def ko lu bah! kailen dekka ci fi chi Egypt ndah ma dundal len ak sen ni jaboot."

When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.

Bi magi Joseph ey dello sen ker te wah sen baye, Jocab, ni Joseph mu ngi dunda ba teeyi, mu beg lool.

Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt with all of his family, and they all lived there. Before Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons.

The covenant promises that God gave to Abraham were passed on to Isaac, then to Jacob, and then to Jacob's twelve sons and their families. The descendants of the twelve sons became the twelve tribes of Israel.
